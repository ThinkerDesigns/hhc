## Silver
You have to complete the frosty keypad one challenge before doing this but once you do, you get the zip of all the images and a python file decoder.
Take the file and put it on your machine in the same directory as the zip (then unzip it).
Run the python file and the image should appear with the instructions. They are hard to read but the settings are below.
GND -> GND
VCC-> VCC
RX -> TX
TX -> RX
USB0/115200/even/7 bit/1 bit/RTS/3V
## Gold
Still figuring out.
